# traffic  detection
This project is a simple implementation of vehicle detection using the OpenCV library in Python. It uses the Haar cascade classifier to detect cars in a video stream from a camera.

Here's an explanation of the code:

1. Importing Libraries:
   - `cv2`: This is the OpenCV library for image processing and computer vision.
   - `imutils`: This library provides convenience functions to simplify image processing tasks.

2. Loading the Haar Cascade Classifier:
   - `cascade_src`: It specifies the path to the XML file containing the trained Haar cascade classifier for car detection.
   - `car_cascade`: It creates an instance of the `CascadeClassifier` class and loads the classifier using the XML file.

3. Initializing the Video Capture:
   - `cam_north`: It initializes the video capture object to read frames from the camera (device index 0).

4. Vehicle Detection Loop:
   - The code enters a loop to continuously read frames from the camera, detect vehicles, and display the frames with bounding boxes around the detected vehicles.
   - `cam_north.read()`: It reads a frame from the camera.
   - `imutils.resize(img1, width=300)`: It resizes the frame to a width of 300 pixels for faster processing.
   - `cv2.cvtColor(img1, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)`: It converts the resized frame to grayscale.
   - `car_cascade.detectMultiScale()`: It detects cars in the grayscale frame using the Haar cascade classifier. The detected cars are returned as a list of bounding box coordinates.
   - The code then iterates over the detected bounding boxes and draws rectangles around the cars using `cv2.rectangle()`.
   - `cv2.imshow("Frame", img1)`: It displays the frame with the bounding boxes.

5. Traffic Analysis:
   - The code counts the number of detected cars (`len(cars)`) and assigns it to the variable `n`.
   - The number of detected cars is printed, and if the count is greater than or equal to 2, it indicates more traffic; otherwise, it indicates no traffic.

6. Exiting the Program:
   - The program exits when the 'Esc' key is pressed.
   - `cam.release()`: It releases the camera.
   - `cv2.destroyAllWindows()`: It closes all windows.

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of vehicle detection using OpenCV and the Haar cascade classifier. It can be further enhanced by using more advanced models and techniques for improved accuracy and performance.
